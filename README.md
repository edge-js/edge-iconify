Edge Iconify

> Iconify integration for Edge template engine

![](./edge_iconify.png)

[Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) is a great collection of over 100 open source icon sets. This package allows you to use all the available icons within edge templates.

## Not using the online mode

Iconify support various icon loading strategies and the most prominent one on their website is the online API. During the online API, the Iconify will make an HTTP call to their API server and returns the icon data in response.

The online API is not really useful on the backend, since bundle size is not really an issue on the server. Also, many companies restricts the outgoing traffic on their production servers and therefore the requests to Iconify API server will fail.

## Using icon bundles

Icon bundles on the other hand are pre-bundled icon sets in JSON files. Iconify has an npm package for every single icon set they support and therefore using them is quite easy.

## Setup

The first step is to install the `edge-iconify` package from the npm registry.

```sh
npm i edge-iconify
```

Register the plugin with the template engine. AdonisJS users can use the `View` object for the same.

```ts
import edge from 'edge.js'
import { edgeIconify } from 'edge-iconify'

edge.use(edgeIconify)
```

That's all you need to do and you are ready to render SVG icons within your edge templates.

## Options
You can pass some options when initializing the plugin for applying a default style to your icons.

```ts
edge.use(edgeIconify, {
  defaultClass: 'text-red hover:text-green', // Class applied to all icons
  scale: 1.8 // Scale of icons in em
})
```

## Setup icon bundles

Before you can render icons, you will have to install the icon set you are planning to use. You can also use multiple icon sets in a single projects.

For this example, we will setup the following two icon sets.

- [HeroIcons Outline](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/heroicons-outline/)
- [Tabler Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/tabler/)

```sh
npm i @iconify-json/heroicons-outline
npm i @iconify-json/tabler
```

Next, use the `addCollection` method exported by the `edge-iconify` package.

```ts
import { addCollection } from 'edge-iconify'
import { icons as tablerIcons } from '@iconify-json/tabler'
import { icons as heroIcons } from '@iconify-json/heroicons-outline'

addCollection(heroIcons)
addCollection(tablerIcons)
```

## Rendering icons

Once, you have installed the icon bundles of your choice. You can render the icons as follows.

```edge
@svg('tabler:app-window', { color: 'purple' })
@svg('heroicons-outline:annotation', { width: 40, height: 40 })
```

Also, you can render the icons using the `svg` global method.

```edge
<a href="">Click here {{ svg('heroicons-outline:arrow-sm-right') }}</a>
```
